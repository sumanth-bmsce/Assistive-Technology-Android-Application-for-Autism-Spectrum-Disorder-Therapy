# Assistive-Technology-Android-Application-for-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Therapy
We, as a team of 4, collectively developed an Assistive Technology android application for autism children of the ASHA Foundation, Bangalore to help them develop the necessary motor skills like finger movements and language understanding under the guidance of Jayashree Ramesh, Director, ASHA Foundation and Dr. Indiramma M, Professor, CSE, BMSCE. We also attended the World Autism Day 2017, at Bal Bhavan, Cubbon Park to spread awareness about autism.
